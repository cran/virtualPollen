        and Niche Traits

Description: Tools to generate virtual environmental drivers with a given temporal autocorrelation, and to simulate pollen curves at annual resolution over millennial time-scales based on these drivers and virtual taxa with different life traits and niche features. It also provides the means to simulate quasi-realistic pollen-data conditions by applying simulated accumulation rates and given depth intervals between consecutive samples.
